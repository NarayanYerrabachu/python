1) Problem Statement:
You work in XYZ Company as a Python. The company officials want you to build machine learning models.

Tasks to beperformed:

1.	Build a decision tree classifier:
- Import diabetes datasets
- Split it into X and Y
- Split X and Y into 70% training set and 30% testing set
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier
- Make Predictions
- Calculate its accuracy

2.	Build a random tree classifier:
	- Import diabetes datasets
- Split it into X and Y
- Split X and Y into 70% training set and 30% testing set
- Train a Random Forest Classifier
- Make Predictions
- Caclulate its accuracy

2) Problem Statement:
You work in XYZ Company as a Python. The company officials want you to write code for a clustering problem.

Tasks to beperformed:

1. K-Means Clustering:
    - Load customer data.
    - Check the number of cells in each column with null values.
    - Create a scatter plot with Age as X and Spending Score as Y.
    - Find out the best number for clusters between1 and 10 (inclusive) using the elbow method.
    - Draw a scatter plot displaying data points colored on the basis of clusters.
